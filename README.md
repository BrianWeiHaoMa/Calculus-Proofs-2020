# Calculus-Proofs-2020
Calculus proofs that I wrote for a problem set (in which I got 96.2%) in MAT137 at UofT in 2020. I am especially proud of my proof for question 4, as I spent a very long time thinking of how to go about it and it was probably the most difficult/tedious math proof I've ever done.
